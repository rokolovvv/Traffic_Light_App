# Traffic Light React App

This project is a simple traffic light simulation built with React, where users can cycle through the colors red, green, and orange by pressing a button. Using `useRef` hooks, the app keeps track of the current active color by adjusting the opacity of each light. The `useEffect` hook sets the initial color to red when the component loads. The `changecolor` function updates the active color by toggling between red, green, and orange states. This project demonstrates the basics of managing state and rendering conditional styles with React.
